# Python Practice by Shreya

Hi there! I'm Shreya, an Electronics & Communication student whoâ€™s passionate about coding and learning tech.

This repository contains my beginner Python projects and daily practice as I learn programming step by step.

## Project 1: Hello World Script

**File:** `hello.py`  
**What it does:** Asks the user for their name and greets them using Python.

## Why Iâ€™m Doing This

- To become confident in Python
- To build projects and contribute to open-source
- To eventually apply for internships, GSoC, and dream tech jobs!
